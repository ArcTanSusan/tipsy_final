<h1 id="tipsy-a-flask-tutorial">Tipsy: A Flask Tutorial</h1>
<p><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a> is a so-called 'microframework' for writing web applications in Python. It's minimalist, and contains nothing but a receptacle in which you might put the components of your kitchen sink. Contrast this with Django, which includes two sinks, a fully-stocked pantry, and a celebrity chef.</p>
<p>This means when we build something with Flask, we have to add everything to the system ourselves. This isn't nearly as hard as it sounds. We'll be using Flask to build a todo-list from the ground up.</p>
<p>Things we will need:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sqlite.org">Sqlite</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.python.org">Python 2.6-ish</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This tutorial is formatted somewhat in the manner of a choose-your-own-adventure. If you're feeling adventurous, you may choose to ignore the supplied hints and strike out on your own as you see fit.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-1-in-which-we-think-about-things">Chapter 1: In Which We Think About Things</h2>
<p>The approach to this project, according to Zebulon's Grand Unified Theory of Application Development, is to first identify the nouns that make up the model. In this case, we don't have a pre-existing project to extract our nouns from, so we'll have to use our imaginations. We start by identifying 'use cases', or descriptions of how a user interacts with our software. We don't necessarily need to understand all the details at this time, just a high level description to help plan our project.</p>
<p>Since our application is a task list, here are some archetypical use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user can log in and view his list</li>
<li>A user must be able to add a new task</li>
<li>A user should be able to mark a task as complete</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Take a few minutes to add to this list. It may help to open a new planning document.</strong></p>
