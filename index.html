<h1 id="tipsy-a-flask-tutorial">Tipsy: A Flask Tutorial</h1>
<p><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a> is a so-called 'microframework' for writing web applications in Python. It's minimalist, and contains nothing but a receptacle in which you might put the components of your kitchen sink. Contrast this with Django, which includes two sinks, a fully-stocked pantry, and a celebrity chef.</p>
<p>This means when we build something with Flask, we have to add everything to the system ourselves. This isn't nearly as hard as it sounds. We'll be using Flask to build a todo-list from the ground up.</p>
<p>Things we will need:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sqlite.org">Sqlite</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.python.org">Python 2.6-ish</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This tutorial is formatted somewhat in the manner of a choose-your-own-adventure. If you're feeling adventurous, you may choose to ignore the supplied hints and strike out on your own as you see fit.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-1-in-which-we-think-about-things">Chapter 1: In Which We Think About Things</h2>
<p>The approach to this project, according to Zebulon's Grand Unified Theory of Application Development, is to first identify the nouns that make up the model. In this case, we don't have a pre-existing project to extract our nouns from, so we'll have to use our imaginations. We start by identifying 'use cases', or descriptions of how a user interacts with our software. We don't necessarily need to understand all the details at this time, just a high level description to help plan our project.</p>
<p>Since our application is a task list, here are some archetypical use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user can log in and view his list</li>
<li>A user must be able to add a new task</li>
<li>A user should be able to mark a task as complete</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Take a few minutes to add to this list. It may help to open a new planning document to keep track, since we don't have a tasklist yet.</strong></p>
<p>From this list, we can identify the following nouns and attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User</strong>
<ul>
<li>id</li>
<li>email</li>
<li>password</li>
<li>name</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Task</strong>
<ul>
<li>id</li>
<li>title</li>
<li>created_at</li>
<li>completed_at</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a good starting point, and we can always add more later.</p>
<p>One thing we need to do next is to identify the relationships between our nouns. We can say that a User <em>has many</em> Tasks, and at the same time, a Task <em>belongs to</em> a User.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2-in-which-we-build-our-database">Chapter 2: In Which We Build Our Database</h2>
<p>Now, we almost have enough information to construct our tables. We have our attributes, our nouns, and our relationships, but we still need to declare what column types these attributes will be. Try to do this yourself, and hover over the spoiler block below if you need hints.</p>
<div class="spoilers">
<ul>
<li><strong>User</strong>
<ul>
<li>id - Integer, Primary Key</li>
<li>email - Varchar(64)</li>
<li>password - Varchar(64)</li>
<li>name - Varchar(64)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Task</strong>
<ul>
<li>id - Integer, Primary Key</li>
<li>title - Varchar(64)</li>
<li>created_at - Datetime</li>
<li>completed_at - Datetime</li>
<li>user_id - Integer</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
Notice the addition of the user_id field to represent the relation.
</div>

<p>The next thing to do is take our definition and build database tables from it. You can use the <a href="http://robotocracy.com/sql/">sql diagram tool</a> from before to generate the sql, or use a <a href="http://souptonuts.sourceforge.net/readme_sqlite_tutorial.html">sqlite tutorial</a> to create the table generation script yourself.</p>
<p>Remember the naming conventions from before: the table name is a capitalized, plural version of the thing it represents.</p>
<p>If you need some help, we've provided the script for you here:</p>
<div class="spoilers">

<pre><code>create table Users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(64),
    password VARCHAR(64),
    name VARCHAR(64)
);
create table Tasks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(64),
    created_at DATETIME,
    completed_at DATETIME,
    user_id INTEGER
);</code></pre>
</div>
